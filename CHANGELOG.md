## Unreleased

### Added
- [#2](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/core/pull/2)
**BREAKING** The `Core\Resources\JsonApiResource` is no longer abstract, and now expects the
schema *and* the model to be injected via its constructor. It will use the schema to convert a
model to a JSON:API resource. This allows the resource classes to be optional, as the resource
resolution logic can now fall-back to the `JsonApiResource` when no specific resource class
exists. Schema fields must implement the `Contracts\Resources\Serializer\Attribute`
and `Contracts\Resources\Serializer\Relation` interfaces on their fields for the serialization
to work.
- **BREAKING** The `Contracts\Encoder\Encoder` contract now has a `withRequest` method to inject the
current HTTP request into the encoding process. The response classes have been updated to pass
the request through to the encoder in their `toResponse()` methods.
- **BREAKING** The `Contracts\Schema\Container` contract now has a `schemaForModel` method to
lookup a schema by providing either a model instance, or the fully-qualified class name of a model.
- **BREAKING** The `Contracts\Schema\ID` contract now has a `key()` method, that can return
the model key for the ID.
- **BREAKING** The `Contracts\Schema\Schema` contract now has a `idKeyName()` method
- New `Contracts\Resources\JsonApiRelation` contract for the relation object returned by the
`JsonApiResource::relationships()` method. This has the methods on it that encoders can rely on when
encoding the relationship to JSON.
- New `Core\Resources\ConditionalIterator` class for iterating over values that could contain
conditional attributes.

### Changed
- **BREAKING** The `attributes`, `relationships`, `meta` and `links` method of the `JsonApiResource`
class now require the request to be passed as a parameter. This is to bring the resource in line
with Laravel's Eloquent resource, though our implementation allows the request to be `null` to
cater for resource encoding outside of HTTP requests (e.g. queued broadcasting). Additionally,
the `relationship` method return type has been changed to the new `Contracts\Resources\JsonApiResource`
contract.
- **BREAKING** The `exists` and `create` methods on the `Contracts\Resources\Container` contract now
correctly type-hint the parameter as an `object`.
- **BREAKING** The `createResource` method on the `Contracts\Resources\Factory` contract now correctly
type-hints the parameter as an `object`.
- **BREAKING** The constructor of the `Core\Resources\Factory` class now expects a schema container
and an optional array of resource bindings (instead of an iterable). If a `null` value is provided
for the bindings, the bindings will be retrieved from the schema container. Additionally, the protected
`build` method signature has been updated to correctly type-hint the second argument as an `object`.
- **BREAKING** The constructor arguments for the `Core\Resources\Relation` class have been changed
so that it now receives the model and base URI - rather than the `JsonApiResource` object. This
change was made so that it can be used more broadly.

### Removed
- **BREAKING** The `attach` and `attachAll` methods of the `Core\Resources\Factory` class have been
removed, because they were not in use.

## [1.0.0-alpha.1] - 2021-01-25
